# B3Z T-cell Activation Plate Configurator

An interactive React component for configuring an 8 x 12 assay plate and generating a reproducible R analysis script for B3Z T-cell activation data.

## What it does

- displays a 96-well plate layout;
- supports medium, positive, and negative controls;
- creates sample groups with custom concentrations;
- creates pasted or serial-dilution concentration series;
- lets you paint, drag across, or erase well assignments;
- generates an R script for ANOVA/Tukey or pairwise t-tests with BH correction;
- creates bar charts, dose-response plots, and an Excel output workbook.

The component is implemented in [T-cell-activation.jsx](T-cell-activation.jsx).

## Biological relevance

B3Z is a reporter T-cell assay used to study antigen-dependent T-cell activation. In an experimental plate, differences in reporter signal can reflect differences in antigen presentation and downstream immune signalling.

The plate configurator supports concentration series, controls, and replicate wells so that activation can be compared across formulations or treatment conditions. The generated background-corrected analysis script provides statistical validation of differences between experimental groups.

## Run in CodeSandbox

1. Create a new React sandbox.
2. Copy `T-cell-activation.jsx` into `src/B3ZConfigurator.jsx`.
3. Replace `src/App.jsx` with:

```jsx
import B3ZConfigurator from "./B3ZConfigurator";

export default function App() {
  return <B3ZConfigurator />;
}
```

4. Start the preview. The component only requires React; it has no additional npm dependency.

## Use the configurator

1. Set the CSV input filename and Excel output filename.
2. Choose `ANOVA + Tukey` or `Pairwise t-tests`.
3. Add or edit control conditions.
4. Add each experimental group and enter concentrations, or use the dilution series controls.
5. Select a condition and click or drag across the appropriate wells.
6. Verify the coloured well counts and click **Generate R Script**.
7. Copy the generated script into a file such as `b3z_analysis.R` and run it with R.

## Expected CSV format

The generated R script expects a semicolon-delimited CSV with a plate layout:

- first column: row labels `A` through `H`;
- next twelve columns: wells `1` through `12`;
- numeric values: OD596 measurements;
- decimal mark: comma by default.

The input file and the generated Excel/PNG outputs can be changed in the configurator before the script is generated.

## Run the generated R script

The generated script installs or loads these packages:

`tidyverse`, `readr`, `ggplot2`, `writexl`, `rstatix`, and `ggpubr`.

Then run:

```bash
Rscript b3z_analysis.R
```

It performs medium-background subtraction, condition summaries, statistical testing, and exports `b3z_results.xlsx`, `b3z_all_conditions.png`, and `b3z_dose_response.png`.

## Data protection

Do not commit raw assay data, patient or donor identifiers, API keys, or generated result files. Use anonymised or synthetic data in a public demo.
